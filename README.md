**Vehicles-Registration-Number-Plate-Detection-And-Recognition**
Vehicles Registration number plate detection app using #flask #Tensorflow #opencv

**Objective**:
I have build the number plate detection model using Deep Learning with----
1. Tensorflow 2.8 SSD Mobilenet V2 Object detection model using transefer leraning, 
2. openCV for image processing 
3. easyocr Optical Character Recognition (OCR)for extracting textual information from number plate.
4. car images dataset taken from kaggle and google image scrapping
5. Flask API
 
After training I have developed the app with the help of flask and actually authenticate it with real time detection!!!
